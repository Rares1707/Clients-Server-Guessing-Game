# Clients-Server-Guessing-Game

## Overview
This is a 'game' played between a multiplexed server and its clients. The server generates a random number and the clients write numbers in the chat trying to guess it. The server receives each number, and tells ALL clients if it is smaller/greater/equal (-1 for smaller, 1 for greater, 0 for equal) to the one they have to guess. The game stops when one of the clients guesses the number.

**Note: The names of the variables may not be easily readable as this 'game' was created under the time constraints of a university exam.**
